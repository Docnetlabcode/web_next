# API Service — REST API Reference

**Base URL (dev):** `http://localhost:5000`  
**Base URL (prod):** `https://api.doklynk.app`  
**All responses:** `{ statusCode, success, data, message }`

> 📦 **Per-module docs** (endpoints + request/response JSON + frontend wiring, one
> file per module) live in **[modules/](modules/index.md)** — start there for
> frontend integration. This file is the single-page quick reference of every route.

## Authentication

All protected endpoints require an `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>` header.  
Web clients also send a CSRF token in `X-CSRF-Token` and receive a `httpOnly` refresh-token cookie.

**Roles:** `doctor` · `student` · `general_user`

> The JWT token (and `user.role` in every response) carries **lowercase** roles — use these for client-side checks. The database stores them uppercase internally. When *sending* a role (e.g. onboarding), either case is accepted; the server normalizes it.

## Auth — `/api/auth`

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/meta/specializations` | — | List medical specializations |
| GET | `/meta/courses` | — | List medical courses |
| POST | `/send-otp` | — | Register login attempt (Firebase sends the SMS client-side) · Rate-limited |
| POST | `/verify-otp` | — | Exchange Firebase ID token → `{ accessToken, refreshToken, user }` |
| POST | `/google` | — | Google OAuth (via Firebase) → `{ accessToken, refreshToken, user }` |
| POST | `/refresh-token` | — | Rotate tokens (cookie or body refresh token) |
| POST | `/logout` | 🔒 | Revoke current session |
| POST | `/logout-all` | 🔒 | Revoke all sessions |
| GET | `/sessions` | 🔒 | List active sessions |
| DELETE | `/sessions/:sessionId` | 🔒 | Revoke one session |

> **Phone auth is Firebase-driven.** The actual SMS OTP is sent by the **Firebase Phone Auth SDK on the client**, not by this API. The flow is:
> 1. `POST /send-otp` — registers intent (sets `role` for new accounts, applies a 60s resend cooldown). Does **not** send an SMS.
> 2. Client calls Firebase `signInWithPhoneNumber(...)` → user enters the code → Firebase returns an ID token via `user.getIdToken()`.
> 3. `POST /verify-otp` with that `firebaseIdToken` — the server verifies it and issues DokLynk tokens.

### POST `/send-otp`
```json
{
  "phoneNumber": "9876543210",
  "countryCode": "+91",
  "role": "doctor"
}
```
`phoneNumber` digits only (no country code). `countryCode` optional (default `+91`). `role` optional (`doctor` | `student` | `general_user`), used only when this becomes a new account.
Returns: `{ "cooldownSeconds": 60 }`

### POST `/verify-otp`
```json
{ "firebaseIdToken": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6..." }
```
`firebaseIdToken` comes from the Firebase SDK after the user confirms the SMS code.
Returns: `{ accessToken, refreshToken, user: UserObject, isNewUser: bool }` (web clients receive the refresh token as an `httpOnly` cookie + a `csrfToken` instead of `refreshToken` in the body).

### POST `/google`
```json
{
  "firebaseIdToken": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIs...",
  "role": "general_user"
}
```
`firebaseIdToken` is the Google sign-in token obtained via Firebase. `role` optional (new accounts only).
Returns: `{ accessToken, refreshToken, user: UserObject, isNewUser: bool }`

### POST `/refresh-token`
- **Mobile:** send `{ "refreshToken": "..." }` in the body.
- **Web:** the `refreshToken` cookie is sent automatically; include the `X-CSRF-Token` header.

Returns a fresh `accessToken` (and rotated refresh token).

## Posts — `/api/posts`

`postType` values: `post` · `research` · `thesis` · `case_study` · `question` · `article`

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/saved` | 🔒 | Saved posts |
| GET | `/trending/hashtags` | — | Top hashtags (Redis cached) |
| GET | `/hashtags/suggest?q=` | — | Hashtag autocomplete |
| GET | `/hashtag/:tag` | 🔓 | Posts by hashtag |

| POST | `/` | 🔒 | Create post `multipart: media (×10)` |
| GET | `/:id` | 🔓 | Post detail |
| PUT | `/:id` | 🔒 | Edit post (blocked after 24 h) |

  "postType": "research",
  "specialties": ["Cardiology", "Interventional Cardiology"],
  "hashtags": ["SCAD", "CardiacImaging"],
  "mentions": ["@drbob", "clxUserId"]

`hashtags` and `mentions` are **dedicated metadata fields** (not parsed from the
caption). `mentions` accepts `@uniqueusername` (case-insensitive) and/or user ids —
resolved server-side and notified. Media via `multipart: media` (≤500MB/file).
Editing (`PUT /:id`) is allowed for 24h on caption/specialties/hashtags/mentions
(media locked); after 24h → `403 { code: "MODIFICATION_LEASE_EXPIRED" }`. Same
rules apply to reels (`POST /api/reels`, video ≤500MB).
Upload `media` (up to 10 files) as `multipart/form-data`.

Use `hlsUrl` (master.m3u8) for playback once status is `COMPLETED`.

> **`GET /feed` is a discovery engine** (`?sessionId=&specialty=&limit=`): true-random
> global selection, 48h watched suppression (`POST /:id/watched`), session de-dup, and
> an exhaustion loop that recycles watched reels. Returns `{ sessionId, reels, hasMore,
> exhausted }`. Full model: [modules/recommendation.md](modules/recommendation.md).

---

## Feed — `/api/feed`

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/guest` | — | Public guest feed |
| GET | `/home` | 🔒 | Session-based weighted-random home feed (`?sessionId=&specialty=&type=&page=`) |
| POST | `/seen` | 🔒 | Log viewed post ids (>1.5s) `{ sessionId, postIds[] }` |
| GET | `/explore` | 🔓 | Explore feed (trending) |
| GET | `/saved` | 🔒 | Saved content feed |
| GET | `/mute` | 🔒 | Muted users list |
| POST | `/not-interested/:postId` | 🔒 | Suppress post |
| POST | `/mute/:userId` | 🔒 | Mute user from feed |
| DELETE | `/mute/:userId` | 🔒 | Unmute |

> **`GET /home` is session/page-based** (not cursor): omit `sessionId` to start a
> session (returned in the response), pass it back with `page=N`. It returns a
> weighted pseudo-random, seen-de-duplicated feed with a `caughtUp`/`exhausted`
> fallback. Explore/saved remain cursor-paginated. Full model:
> [modules/recommendation.md](modules/recommendation.md).

`GET /home` filters by creator specialty (`?specialty=Cardiology&type=research`).
Each card's `author` block carries **`isFollowing`** + **`connectionStatus`** so the
header renders the right button (State A/B): own post → owner menu · `!isFollowing` →
**Follow** · following + `connectionStatus` `none`→**Connect**, `connected`→**Message**,
`pending_outgoing`→Connecting, `pending_incoming`→Accept. The like-lists
(`GET /api/posts/:id/likes`, `/api/reels/:id/likes`) carry the same fields + `isSelf`.

---

## Follows — `/api/follows`

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/suggestions` | 🔒 | Suggested users to follow |
| GET | `/check/:userId` | 🔒 | Follow relationship → `{ status: following\|requested\|not_following, isFollowedBy }` |
| GET | `/requests` | 🔒 | Incoming follow requests (private account) |
| POST | `/requests/:requesterId/accept` | 🔒 | Confirm a follow request |
| POST | `/requests/:requesterId/reject` | 🔒 | Ignore a follow request (silent) |
| DELETE | `/requests/:targetId` | 🔒 | Withdraw your pending request (silent) |
| DELETE | `/followers/:userId` | 🔒 | Remove a follower |
| POST | `/:userId` | 🔒 | Follow — **public** = instant `{status:following}`; **private** = `{status:requested}` |
| DELETE | `/:userId` | 🔒 | Unfollow user |
| GET | `/:userId/followers` | 🔓 | Follower list |
| GET | `/:userId/following` | 🔓 | Following list |

**Follow state machine.** Public targets are followed instantly (+counts, "started
following you" notification). Private targets get a pending request → the target
sees it in `GET /requests` and **Confirms** (follow established + counts, requester
notified) or **Ignores** (silent). The requester can **withdraw** while pending.
`GET /check/:userId` drives the button label: `not_following`→Follow, `requested`→
Requested, `following`→Following; `isFollowedBy` → show "Follow Back". **State B:**
when `following`, surfaces (feed card + like-list) show a **Message** button
(`POST /api/chat/start`) instead of Follow. Unfollow = `DELETE /:userId` (counts −1,
mapping removed).
